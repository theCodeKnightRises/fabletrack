				"Before FableTrack, I was constantly forgetting what I had read, losing track of half-finished books,
				and struggling to connect insights across stories. This template completely changed the way I read. Now,
				every highlight, theme, and reflection is stored in one place, beautifully organized and easy to
				revisit. It's not just a tracker - it's my personal reading hub that grows with me. For anyone who wants
				to read with more clarity, purpose and joy, I can't recommend it enough."
